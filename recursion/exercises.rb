# (1) Define a recursive function that finds the factorial of a number.
#     e.g. factorial(4) = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24

# (2) Define a recursive function that returns true if a string is a palindrome and false otherwise.
#     A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward.
#     e.g. 'radar', 'level', 'kayak'

# (3) Define a recursive function that takes an argument n and returns the fibonacci value of that position.
#     The fibonacci sequence is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...etc
#     So fibonacci(5) should return 5 and fibonacci(6) should return 8.

# (4) Define a recursive function that flattens an array.
#     The method should convert [[1, 2], [3, 4]] to [1, 2, 3, 4],
#     and convert [[1, [8, 9]], [3, 4]] to [1, 8, 9, 3, 4].
